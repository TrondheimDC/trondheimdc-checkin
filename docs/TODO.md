# Remaining work

Backlog for TDC Innsjekk. Check items off as they land.

**MVP done?** Use the hardware QA checklist in [MVP-verification.md](./MVP-verification.md) — onboarding on iOS and Android, day-of scan/print, admin/deploy, and sign-off.

Brother docs hub: [Smooth Print HTML documentation](https://support.brother.com/g/s/es/htmldoc/smoothprint/) — also summarized in [RESEARCH.md](../RESEARCH.md).

## High priority

### Auto-pair via Smooth Print URL schemes + QR

**Goal:** scan a QR (or open a link) that runs Smooth Print find/connect so the phone attaches to the right QL without the long manual Bluetooth + “I see it in the app” dance.

Docs:

- [Find printer](https://support.brother.com/g/s/es/htmldoc/smoothprint/reference/find_printer/)
- [Connect printer](https://support.brother.com/g/s/es/htmldoc/smoothprint/reference/connect_printer/)
- [Printer status](https://support.brother.com/g/s/es/htmldoc/smoothprint/reference/printer_status/) (useful once connected)

Tasks:

- [x] Spike UI via `/koble` → now redirects into `/oppsett` (MAC/serial/model → tap → `brotherwebprint://connect`)
- [x] Setup QR payload is https `/oppsett?path=qr&…` (also accepts legacy `/koble?…`); admin stickers print that link
- [x] `/oppsett` happy path: Android — install → printer BT on → Skann QR → `connect` → test print. iOS — same prelude, then **OS Bluetooth pair** (MFi) before `connect` → test print. Manual fallback from scan: OS pair → select in Smooth Print → test. See [RESEARCH.md → Setup order](../RESEARCH.md#setup-order--decision-2026-09-27-revised-same-day)
- [x] Fix: sticker QR deep link (`path=qr&step=connect`) skipped install/Bluetooth-on prelude on a fresh phone — now shown once, then a primed session resumes instantly on refresh/deeplink (`src/app/oppsett/setup-flow.tsx`)
- [x] Android: install with Ferdig (do not open the app); force-close Smooth Print only before print (overlay dialog). Connect opens the app when needed.
- [x] Connect URL scheme checked against Brother docs — `buildConnectQuery` matches (`connecttype`, `connectaddress`, `serialnum`, `model`); `connectcallback` omitted (new-tab problem)
- [x] Android: sticker / in-app `brotherwebprint://connect` verified on hardware (happy path without OS-pair-first).
- [x] **Android onboarding grade-A** (2026-09-27): install → Ferdig (don’t open) → verify BT icon → Skann QR → connect (permissions/terms/BT on cold start) → returns to browser → force-close → test print overlay. Manual fallback also works.
- [x] **iOS onboarding verified** (2026-09-28): App Store install → verify BT → **OS Bluetooth pair required before connect** (MFi) → Skann QR / sticker `connect` → test print. Wizard inserts the pair step on the QR path; documented in [RESEARCH.md](../RESEARCH.md) and `/oppsett`.
- [x] iOS connect without prior OS pair fails (Failure / Not connected) — expected; pair step is on the happy path, not only the manual fallback
- [x] `brotherwebprint://print` had no return-to-webapp callback — wired up `successCallback`/`failureCallback` (https URLs back to `/deltaker/[id]`) in `src/lib/print-url.ts` + `src/components/print-button.tsx`; confirmed on iOS that it does return to Safari and appends its own `errorCode=SUCCESS`
- [x] Callback opened a **new Safari tab per print** on iOS (confirmed on hardware; a fragment-based callback is not an option — Smooth Print percent-encodes `#` into the path and concatenates without a separator). Mitigated: `print-button.tsx` now pre-sets the tab's address bar to the exact success-callback shape before firing the print (iOS only), so a successful print should match and reuse the tab; failure still opens a new tab
- [x] Retest on iOS: tab-reuse pre-set works — Safari reuses the tab. But it still does a **full reload** (not caused by our own `replaceState` calls, confirmed — see [RESEARCH.md](../RESEARCH.md)), which flashes the whole app + attendee loading skeletons on every print
- [x] Android badge print: omit `successCallback`/`failureCallback` — Chrome always opened a new tab per callback (worse than Smooth Print's dialog on the same tab). Dialog only works if Smooth Print is **not** already in the background; otherwise print switches into the app. iOS keeps the callback + address-bar pre-set. See [RESEARCH.md → Android omit](../RESEARCH.md#android-omit-print-callbacks--decision-2026-09-27)
- [x] Faster turnaround idea (navigate to `/` via `visibilitychange` as soon as the tab regains focus after Smooth Print, instead of waiting on the callback's reload): tried, found a bug before it ever reached hardware (flag never clears on a successful print since a reload never fires `visibilitychange`, so the next unrelated app-switch would misfire a navigation), reverted — see [RESEARCH.md](../RESEARCH.md). Worth another idea for turnaround speed, but not this one as-is
- [x] Attendee list at 900 people (fine at ~700 on real use, so no cap or pagination): decide whether `/sok` should show everyone by default when the search box is empty (currently only searches once you type). Full virtualization is real integration work, not cheap — `cmdk`'s keyboard nav (arrow keys / Home / End) queries the live DOM for all rendered items, so a windowed subset breaks it unless carefully coordinated. Cheaper path: cap the default list (e.g. first ~150) or paginate/"load more", not true virtualization; needs a persisted setting too if we keep the current empty-state (`useLocalFlag`, same pattern as "Vis innsjekkede")

## Before the conference (MVP polish)

### Host Smooth Print APK

- [x] Admin inventory at `/admin/smooth-print`: upload APK, activate/deactivate (one active), delete
- [x] Store files under `data/apks/` (gitignored); stream active via `GET /api/smooth-print/apk`
- [x] `/oppsett` uses hosted APK when one is active; otherwise Brother agreement page
- [x] Conference APK uploaded and active (staff setup day)

### Auth & printere

**Decided.** Full design: [auth-printers.md](./auth-printers.md).

better-auth + better-auth-ui. Roles: `admin` | `printer`. Creating a printer also creates door login (`prt_` token + PIN). Stickers use `PUBLIC_URL` (default production). `/oppsett` / `/koble` / APK require door session. No nginx basic auth; Checkin is not the staff IdP.

- [x] Add better-auth (Drizzle/LibSQL), admin plugin, roles `admin` / `printer`
- [x] User fields: `validFrom`, `validTo`, optional `printerId`; long `session.expiresIn` + enforce validity window
- [x] Middleware / route gates: door + admin APIs require session; `/oppsett`, `/koble`, active APK gated as door
- [x] Install better-auth-ui (shadcn): `@better-auth-ui/auth`, `admin`, `user-button` + Sonner; Norwegian localization
- [x] Admin sign-in (`/auth/sign-in`) + door `/logg-inn` (PIN + magic token); better-auth-ui SignIn + username for admin
- [x] Admin `/admin/brukere` via better-auth-ui; `UserButton` in admin shell
- [x] `/admin/printers` inventory + `/admin/printers/ny` enroll (hardware + door login)
- [x] Setup sticker + login sticker; Rotér PIN / Ny innloggings-QR
- [x] Door `/logg-inn`: token + PIN; Vis PIN in admin
- [x] Stamp `check_events` with acting printer/user for audit
- [x] Super-admin seeded from `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` on boot; env in `.env.example` / README
- [x] Protect CSV import and other admin mutations behind admin role
- [x] `PUBLIC_URL` for sticker origins (defaults to production, including localhost)

### Admin CSV upload

- [x] Admin UI to upload a Checkin totalrapport CSV (same rules as `pnpm import:attendees`)
- [x] Printer inventory at `/admin/printers`: name, Bluetooth MAC, serial, model
- [x] Enroll flow with illustrations, sticker preview, and print of a DK-11208 label (name above QR → `/oppsett?path=qr`)
- [ ] Confirm the generated `printer.lbx` QR actually prints on the QL (template is hand-built, not from P-touch Editor)
- [x] Guide illustrations share one SVG kit (`src/components/illustrations`) drawn after the real QL-820NWBc: `/oppsett` Bluetooth, pair, scan (sticker on the front); `/logg-inn` (underside → printer); enroll + empty inventory
- [x] Login sticker says «Logg inn · {name}» so it can’t be mixed up with the setup sticker (bare name). Stickers printed before this still work — reprint only if you want the new text (same token)
- [x] `/oppsett` confirm step (`step=confirm`, manual path) uses real Smooth Print screenshots
- [x] Replace attendee list via API; show import counts / skipped rows
- [x] Keep CLI import as a fallback ([checkin-totalrapport.md](./checkin-totalrapport.md))

### Day-of readiness

- [x] Confirm a **real ticket QR** payload matches the totalrapport `Barcode` column (scan → correct attendee)
- [x] Full happy path on **Android** (scan → confirm → print)
- [x] Smoke-test print on **iOS Safari** (2026-09-28; badge print OK — see [RESEARCH.md](../RESEARCH.md))
- [ ] Re-import totalrapport near the event (and morning-of) so late signups / cancellations are in
- [x] Phone↔printer topology: **one phone per printer** (agreed; Brother does not document whether a second phone can steal Bluetooth while the first is still paired)
- [x] **Deploy:** HTTPS + base path / nginx on the conference host (camera + custom schemes need secure context; no basic auth in front — app sessions). Live; nginx `client_max_body_size` raised to 300m for APK uploads.

## Beyond MVP

### Live Checkin integration

Not required to call MVP done (CSV + planned re-import is enough for day-of). Still a follow-up task — decide architecture before coding.

**Open decision — how we talk to Checkin:**

| Mode | Summary |
|---|---|
| Live API | Door actions hit Checkin (or a proxy) each time — freshest, but network/Checkin become hard dependencies |
| Periodic sync + forced sync | Local DB remains source of truth for scan/print; sync on an interval; staff can force “Sync now” — closer to today’s CSV model, survives brief outages, with a staleness window |
| Hybrid | e.g. local lookup/print + live mark-checked-in (or the reverse) |

Pros/cons and sign-off context: [MVP-verification.md → Checkin integration](./MVP-verification.md#checkin-integration).

Tasks:

- [ ] Decide mode (live API vs periodic + forced sync vs hybrid vs CSV-only for this conference)
- [ ] Pull attendees from Checkin API instead of (or in addition to) CSV upload
- [ ] Map barcode / ticket QR to the same id the scanner expects
- [ ] Optional: sync check-in events back to Checkin if that matters for the door/ops workflow
- [ ] Fall back to CSV/admin upload (or last good sync) if the API is down on the day

`tdc-sales` already talks to Checkin’s GraphQL for sales; reuse patterns where they fit. For badge print, barcode must match scan text — confirm that before dropping CSV.

### Desktop printing (WebUSB)

**Exploratory, but direction is set:** land on **WebUSB** from Chromium. Network print agents, TCP `:9100` relays, and OS-driver/`window.print()` paths are too much pain for the gain — park them.

Phone MVP stays on Smooth Print. Desktop skips Smooth Print / LBX and talks to the QL over USB from the browser.

**Hardware (QL-820NWBc):**

- **USB host** (scanner on the printer): **no** on NWBc — ticket scan on desktop is PC webcam / USB HID wedge / paste.
- **USB device** (Type-B → PC): **yes** — this is the WebUSB path.

**Scope we accept:**

| | |
|---|---|
| OS | macOS / Windows / Linux (wherever Chrome/Edge + WebUSB work with the QL) |
| Browsers | Chromium-based only today ([Can I use WebUSB](https://caniuse.com/webusb)) — not Firefox/Safari |
| API | [`navigator.usb`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebUSB_API) + Brother raster encode (e.g. [`@thermal-label/brother-ql-web`](https://thermal-label.github.io/brother-ql/web)) |
| Not doing | Local print agent, server→`:9100`, Web Serial/BT, system print dialog |

Secure context + user gesture for the device picker. Confirm **DK-11208** media id and layout vs phone `badge.lbx`.

**Separate setup flow** (do not overload phone `/oppsett`):

- e.g. `/oppsett/desktop` — feature-detect `"usb" in navigator`; `requestDevice` → test print → remember via `getDevices()`
- Unsupported browser copy: **«Bruk en nettleser som støtter WebUSB»** — note that only Chromium-based browsers do today; link [caniuse.com/webusb](https://caniuse.com/webusb)
- Day-of print uses the open WebUSB session; phones keep Smooth Print

**UI:** phone-first today — likely need a light desktop mode (wider search, keyboard, non-camera ticket input). Decide during spike.

Tasks:

- [x] Canvas badge renderer from the LBX layout (`src/lib/badge-render.ts`) + live preview in `/admin/testutskrift`
- [x] WebUSB connection store (`src/lib/usb-printer.ts`): picker, silent reconnect via `getDevices()`, status preflight, Norwegian errors
- [x] `/oppsett` on PC/Mac → USB wizard (`usb` → `driver` (Windows/Linux only) → `connect` → `test-print`)
- [x] Wire attendee confirm → WebUSB print (`PrintButton`); check-in only after the printer checks out; phones keep Smooth Print
- [x] Document Chrome/Edge-only, drivers and library gaps in [RESEARCH.md](../RESEARCH.md#desktop-printing-webusb)
- [x] **Hardware:** print one badge from Chrome on Mac — lands on the label (margin pins 12/295), same way up as phone, font looks right
- [x] **Hardware:** Mac and Windows (Zadig → WinUSB) connect
- [ ] **Hardware:** Linux (udev) connect
- [x] Printer stickers (`admin/sticker.tsx`) over USB — setup + login QR drawn in the browser (`renderSticker`)
- [ ] **Hardware:** scan a USB-printed sticker QR with a phone

### Check-in dashboard and replay

See and replay the day afterwards: how check-in went, how long it took, and how arrivals were spread over time.

- [ ] Chart of checked-in attendees over time (cumulative and per-interval, e.g. per 5 / 15 minutes), built from `check_events` timestamps
- [ ] Replay the day: scrub or play a timeline and watch the count build up
- [ ] Key numbers: first and last check-in, peak arrival rate, time to reach 50 / 90 %, share of attendees who never checked in
- [ ] Optional breakdown per door / printer (events already carry the acting printer or user)
- [ ] Decide where it lives (admin page vs. the existing stats on search) and whether it updates live during the day

### Own P-touch / template editor

- [ ] Build (or adopt) a **custom template editor** so we are not dependent on Brother P-touch Editor on Windows for badge layout changes
- [ ] Export / maintain `.lbx` (or an equivalent Smooth Print understands) with named objects `NAME` / `LINE2` (or configurable)
- [ ] Keep a path back to hand-edited LBX for emergencies

### More Smooth Print schemes (after auto-pair spike)

- [ ] Use **printer status** before print / on errors once connect works
- [ ] Wire other useful schemes into print recovery
- [ ] Document which schemes work from Safari / Chrome with a user gesture

Supported platforms (for staff phones): iOS 14.1+, Android 8.0+; Bluetooth Classic (MFi on iOS) and Wi-Fi — see [RESEARCH.md](../RESEARCH.md).

### Postponed (not this conference)

- [ ] Compare **`fileattach` (base64)** vs **`filename=<https://…/badge.lbx>`** on iOS and Android — reliability, speed, template updates ([RESEARCH.md](../RESEARCH.md)). Current `fileattach` path is fine for day-of.

## Nice to have

### PWA

- [ ] Decide whether PWA / “Add to Home Screen” is worth it for door staff (install prompt, offline shell, icon, full-screen). Weigh iOS Safari limits vs Android, and whether a normal bookmark is enough for a two-day conference.

### Other

- [ ] Clearer empty/error states when Smooth Print is missing on iOS (Android already has intent fallback to `/oppsett`)
- [ ] Stats / simple ops view (checked-in count is already on search; maybe a dedicated board)
